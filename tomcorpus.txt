for me the fact that she was republican who looked at empirical evidence changed her mind and devoted her entire life to helping with the problems she saw is huge selling point it shows she well intentioned and able to evolve from new information

way to jump to racism to attempt to side step the issues do you think the people killed by guns in chicago last week were killed by angry white men

sergeant always refreshingly on the ball thankfully doesnã â â pull her punches good team with the always politically honest kleeman tho her leftist views ainã â â mine
actually do we all should she bounces around lot warren as does sanders for that matter just donã â â feel like either is ever really being upfront with us ya know 
you blatantly lied by claiming something was proof when you knew that it wasn you could have just said you couldn find it you have thus confirmed everything that people think about syl supporters well done 
i enjoy watching warren erode his base without even having to get messy if it was hurting her campaign iã â â like to see her address it but this just makes bernie look bad 
sarandon doesn matter only people who care what she says are people already in her camp when someone politically important hits you need to be prepared to respond but not necessarily every celebrity with an opinion

are you sure 
how else would it work for them in white patriarchal society itã â â no ã â â mysteryã â â that all the candidates of color have less media air time than their white counterparts
what do you mean war they re candidates competing for the same office he was running first and all his ideas listed above are indeed his well laid out plans for ages all lifted by her seriously considered her even loved her for bit she herself changed my mind 
if she works hard to underplay trump will roll over her like steam roller
she asked for women 
 months ago was thrilled to see warren in the field and was hoping to god she would come through with real progressive stuff if she had d be pushing so hard for her if she had truly embraced bernie policies and philosophy that would be amazing but no not only did 
come on tom time getting close when you need to be on the right team tom_watson twitter com ackersstan status ã â ã â â 
why should even one democrat risk her seat to put an asterisk next to trump name 
yup how terrible btw just out of curiosity sheã â â returning any donations that are high dollar right this ainã â â just political pandering to give the impression she ainã â â taking rich peoples right 
both her bernie grifters what do expect
