 justinegreening wants to abolish the treasury she saw it as major impediment to her doing her job as education secretary but also to the pms work it obstructs rather than advances social mobility hansard parliament uk commons debates fde a be dcc socialmobilitytreasuryreformã â ã â â socialmobility
shame she wasnã â â honest with her constituents such as myself last time out when she stood on the tory manifesto of respecting the referendum result 
you moaned about being told by text that you had lost the whip yet you had been warned that would happen so why be surprised am glad you are not standing again you also praise someone who ratted on his brother good riddance to both of you 
justine greening seems pretty set on stopping prorogation by any means necessary and has called out fellow opponents of no deal in her party for not being ballsy enough right now d say her voting in no confidence is also pretty likely twitter com justinegreening status ã â ã â â

itã â â be interesting to setup another twitter account as hard right leaver and give the same offer theyã â â have you on in heartbeat 
would have been shown more respect if she supported her party when are these sycophants going to realise what they are doing they bitch about democracy whilst denying democracy pathetic

i wasnã â â going to bother to respond to ã â â stupidsã â â but as you are both retarded will spare you the trial of playing with each otherã â â s for hours iã â â ve written it in ã â â big to help you the meaning consequences of voting ã â â leaveã â â were clearly spelled out before the referendum
no we don we need the result of the first referendum to be implemented perhaps ms greening would like to show the way by calling by election to see if her constituents still feel the same about her 
justine greening is my preferred candidate but she has alienated herself from party colleagues on brexit not her fault though as she fought for her principles justinegreening is an outstanding politician though justinegreening
oh shit there might be an election coming up better throw some crumbs to the serfs 
she whines on about years of service how about the other perspective that after supporting her for years she stabbed her party in the back typical remainer that can only see things from their own point of view

i totally agree with you that why it puzzles me that she didn put her name to the letter 
why when you betrayed the public did no one tell you that you have to earn respect
yes marysia you are right am sorry missed her out but was so very cross when wrote it x
well guess andrealeadsom being mother of three would mean that she had very real stake in the future of all children because mothers not fathers or women with no children are the best so as education secretary no admit she was good as leader of the house

it a choice because you were pretending that you were concerned about people getting to hospital whereas the real reason is the impact on your right to drive everywhere consider that had the bridge not been overloaded by so much traffic for so long it might still be fine
