79,2019-03-30,Sir Alan Duncan,Dominic Grieve is an MP of the utmost integrity. The fact that he is being threatened by his former UKIP opponent who has joined his local Association with lots of other newcomers is entryism that undermines the Party in a sinister way. All should back Dominic.,neither
