depends if you want shout out for your latest fundraising event or your garden fete opening that seems to be all heidiallen does for sth cambs constituents these days don you know she far too important to deal with the hoi polloi 
told you so twitter com steven_swinford status â 
excuse me who are you 
you left because youâ re remain blow hard who belongs in the lib dems 
as like most dishonourable mps she will never stand in by election because she knows the voters will kick her out and rightly so 
as far as m concerned heidiallen is unelected and member of parliament by fraud if she was confident that her constituency backed her she would have by election the fact that she not shows she doesn give fuck what the people who elected her want 
not as much as we are when you lied to your constituents again when the by election pic twitter com mqxnebf
exactly but heidi doesnâ care about her constituents itâ all about her career like most of them itâ an issue that needs addressing urgently if these mps want to move parties it should be compulsory that they hold by election 
i seeâ heidiallenâ is no longer in the tory party how about people vote in her constituency for people who voted for her to reconsider their choice of mp as things seem to have changed
itâ been fantastic couple of days watching all you remainiacs go into meltdown on twitter iâ lovinâ every minute
is she still around gone very quiet no more photo opportunities to toss her hair back 
yes please canâ wait to get my chance to get rid of her if wanted liberal iâ have voted for one 
not as much as we are angry at you joswinson libdems forchange_now thegreenparty anyway what have you got to be angry about you re just very bitter twisted jealous loser no one has faith in you anymore no one wants you not even the lib dems 
nobody cares what you feel 
not as angry as brexiteers who you have disrespected yes us the electorate who actually pay your wage you are undemocratic eu shillpic twitter com dutluzhq

toads like you should never have got near the conservative party 
here you go pic twitter com rwiblljf
ever noticed how heidi allen hoc squatter constantly denies democracy by refusing to allow her former constituents those who voted for her as conservative mp by election to decide if they still want her to represent them in parliament not that she cares anyway 
wtf have missed an election or has the result of the next one been fixed if an election is going to be fixed at least wait until after the count to name new mp as far as know heidiallen is my mp remember her was tory but had conscience www facebook com events â 
i one of her constituents and she has never replied to my request for by election 
how do you know and it isn trolling to ask someone who was voted in as member of one party but then leaves that party to let her constituents have say so remind me when is the by election 
i was one of those now very unhappy voters that voted her in but she no longer represents what voted for myself and my family have had discussions and none of us would vote her in again 
not at all voted her in and am having to wait patiently to vote her out she never responds to her constituents not me anyway 
you joining her on the ld benches heidi 
i donâ remember heidiallen complaining about the confidence supply agreement between the dup conservative party after ge when she was tory when is she going to hold by election after defecting for the sake of her constituents that elected tory mp cnews
even although time after time nicolasturgeon ianblackfordmp have said that they would much rather that the uk would stay within the eu which would be the best outcome for everyone involved you really do have cow shit in you re ears don you you just choose anything as snpbad
yes also heard your leader jo swindon rule it our completely her objective is to have coalition that get her into number so no deal to be done there and no change in your party selfserving morals 
no shit sherlock scottish party founded to fight for scottish independence who ever thought that could happen remember when the parasitic libdems used to tell us they wanted federal uk have they dumped that policy as well as no to raising tuition fees

 heidiallen you should take this down lot of well qualified people have pointed out this article makes assertions that are wrong in law you have been supplied with high quality alternative advice from prof markelliott a spells out that reentry has to be by a route
yes cabinet of white middle class women even less diverse than boris johnson government that ll do it sigh 
the first all white cabinet in while 
wow that list as white as vanilla take it she doesn believe women mp of colour can hack it she continues to fall in my estimate
i said it was only matter of time before strategically inept remainers came up with an even worse plan than cobbling together an unelected foil brexit at any cost coalition to allow boris fucking johnson to seize the moral high ground and you ve done it amazing stupidity 
says one who has no backbone is scared hold by election after leaving her party heidi the hypocrite
he gaslighting you 
the desperation of remoaners knows no bounds maybe heidiallen should join carolinelucas with her newly proposed white women only cabinet to take over from boris now that would be an even bigger joke than changeuk twitter com davidallengreen status â 
not one true lefty in the lot as iâ ve always said if anyone thinks the greens will support the poorest theyâ re barking up the wrong tree all white middle class and ignoring the fact that hackneyabbott is the most experienced female mp in parliament either barely hidden
lost respect for her when she tolerated paedophile as an election agent
i donâ see how you could have one without her you canâ ignore scotland 
as much as like her dont see how nicola sturgeon could be part of gnu cabinet 
how would ireland be fucked if brexit is such good idea 
she has made her choice sheâ sold her soul to the brexit devil 
one man running the undemocratic eu yet that makes no difference to you at all 
consider joining her heidiallen 
what amazes me about sarahwollaston heidiallen anna_soubry is that being conservative is much more than the eu issue it is about the fundamental core beliefs values that underpin your outlook actions over your whole life how can you discard all that over one issue twitter com christopherhope status â 
somewhat better to have formidable decisive thinking leader who commands respect than his dreadful predecessor who was permanently bunkered down in her office incapable of running sandwich stall at her annual church fãªte 
out of curiosity what do you think is to be gained by being rude towards strangers on twitter g if you were showing child how to use twitter would you say hey there this great way you can go round insult people let me show you 
to be fair think chukaumunna is more worried about his seat the gravy train is grinding to halt heâ gonna get his ass licked in streatham as will sarahwollaston heidiallen in their constituencies oh dear never mind 
 sarahwollaston anna_soubry heidiallen theresa_may since she is so keen on assigning characteristics based on gender does carolinelucas believe that women are the most dishonest mps or can she remind us of her admiration for margaret thatcher 
i agree with you sheâ irrelevant and pity the next party she latches on to do yourselves favour and give her wide berth and her hairdressing bill must be horrendous 
you couldnâ make this up sam what balls up 
have by election or be quite as everyone thinks you completely undemocratic untrustworthy they are rightpic twitter com serdhjzepm
how can you talk about democracy when you have ignored the vote of million perhaps you will allow by election in order that as constituent can actual have an mp who will correspond with me rather than just ignore me
rt if you believe heidiallen should seek by election to validate her change of party allegiance before lecturing borisjohnson on how to run the country 
brexit cultists will still blame eu for what that they have done with the uk and will not take owneship of it it project fart who shit in my pants 
funny that as my mp she does actually represent me and is very accessible open and popular mp in her constituency there is no requirement for by election if an mp changes party or becomes independent not everyone will like it but currently prefer ind to con so great 
as one on your employers you know the electorate those you work for feel it only right that boris on my behalf rejects your request mps have worked hard this year trying to stop brexit so you deserve holiday don want to be taken to court for overworking you 
 heidiallen looks decent at face value then you look at what she put her name to when she voted it made her tears at food banks more ludicrous she enabled austerity 
if pm won recall isn it time you just all got back to work even if you have to set up across the road rorystewartuk sandbach yvettecoopermp keir_starmer tom_watson joswinson carolinelucas davidlammy hilarybennmp heidiallen ianblackfordmp twitter com martinremains status â 
nobody can really know until the result is in in the meantime she was voted in to represent her constituents to the best of her ability after the result of the referendum 
rightly so

 heidiallen you have bloody cheek you are nobody nothing you squat in seat but refuse by election nah love you don get to tell anybody anything 
it is vital we stop that arrogant old hypocrite heidiallen from undermining democracy the country voted to leave and she was elected as conservatives promising to deliver brexit she is now hard remoaner but no sight of by election look in the mirror you ghastly woman
you have to give heidi her due she stepped up to the mark when needed not for her career heidiallen
it is indeed iâ bloody glad that had an amazing leader in heidiallen strong and gutsy woman who could aspire to be like one who always made sure was never sitting on the sidelines always getting involved she knew about my issues thatâ why she got me involved twitter com camjbradbury status â 
i would be happy to reunite you guys in the job centre does that count as putting my country first 
you all need to work together to block this disastrous no deal work with uklabour and stop playing petty politics you ve all got one aim so go and do it or you will regret it 
should heidiallen resign her seat by applying to the chiltern hundreds as she no longer sits as conservative mp for which she was elected heidiallen chilternhundreds resign
what cant understand all these remainiacs saying it was an advisory referendum then what the hell was the point of the vast majority of the people voting for their decision to be ignored we may as all went nah you re going to ignore us so what the point

psst voted for heidiallen on the basis of what she said and stood for before the ge and what she confirmed as her position after the referendum she can change her point of view but think she should ask her constituents if they agree with her change by election please

again not on the back of bus that all you need to know anna_soubry joswinson jeremycorbyn heidiallen chukaumunna it the reason you all need to work to revokearticle
not about careers says the woman who has refused to let her electorate decide her fate 
i a south cambridgeshire constituent who voted her in and voted leave as did the majority of the uk as whole so no she is not representing me and won be voting for her again 
until you have by election nobody is listening to you
this is nonsense picked up from tabloid headlines and facebook johnson no leader and no great ideas man either and if you think putting an old white male etonian oxford alumnus with floppy hair in charge of the country is going to help improve representation then 
in the case of heidiallen itâ all about her career why else would her ilk accuse brexit supporters of being scared of peoplesvote while rabid remoaners like her break their promises and hijack democracy all the while refusing to check their mandate with constituents twitter com heidiallen status â 
you sound so very lovely wish you everything you deserve 
and just who the hell are you to pass judgement on anyone this is mob rule itâ called de individuation look it up
