Is crucial for #Roehampton and #Putney communities. pic.twitter.com/ak8KV8Hx1g",neither
10,2019-09-05,Justine Greening,.@JoJohnsonUK it was fantastic working with you at the DfE and itâs a real loss for Parliament. But youâre totally right that national interest comes first. #overandout https://twitter.com/JoJohnsonUK/status/1169555292918571008Â â¦,neither
0,2019-09-30,Justine Greening,Social mobility is a problem for business too - I hope that more businesses can commit to â¦@thesmpledgeâ© and be part of the solution on getting more opportunities for more young people. #socialmobility https://www.managementtoday.co.uk/justine-greening-the-link-effort-reward-broken-down/food-for-thought/article/1660695Â â¦,neither

44,2019-06-20,Justine Greening,So weâre on the Wimbledon train waiting at Earlâs Court. Another Wimbledon train comes into next platform but goes first. Then our Wimbledon train destination is changed to Parsons Green. Itâs a badly run service for our community @TfL & @MayorofLondon. Needs to get a lot better.,neither
