75,no we don we need the result of the first referendum to be implemented perhaps ms greening would like to show the way by calling by election to see if her constituents still feel the same about her 
76,justine greening is my preferred candidate but she has alienated herself from party colleagues on brexit not her fault though as she fought for her principles justinegreening is an outstanding politician though justinegreening
77,oh shit there might be an election coming up better throw some crumbs to the serfs 
78,she whines on about years of service how about the other perspective that after supporting her for years she stabbed her party in the back typical remainer that can only see things from their own point of view

88,well guess andrealeadsom being mother of three would mean that she had very real stake in the future of all children because mothers not fathers or women with no children are the best so as education secretary no admit she was good as leader of the house
